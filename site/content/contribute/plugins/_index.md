Mattermost plugins are isolated pieces of code, separate from the main repositories, used to extend the functionality of the Mattermost server and webapp.

### Help Wanted Tickets

Each plugin's Help Wanted tickets are located in that plugin's GitHub repository. There is a [dedicated issue](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server/issues/12656) in the server repository with links to specific plugin repositories, and queries for Help Wanted tickets in each repository. The `All Plugins Up for Grabs` link there is useful to browse all repos at once.
